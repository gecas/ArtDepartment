<p>Art Department Masterclass is a brand new educational and training programme, designed to encourage a professional dialogue between the rising and experienced heroes of the art department. Such medium is essential to fully investigate the process of creativity through interaction, develop new collaborative relations, improve your constructive skills, find fresh ideas and get inspired by top professionals of the industry.
 
Our project aims to provide an innovative attitude towards the various careers of the art department and suggests to cross the boundary dividing traditional topics from the multidisciplinary fields.
 
	To be a part of the art department always refers to the novel world building. But even God got tired doing it on the 7th day. We know how crucial can creativity become without a proper guidance. Art Department Masterclass will offer you all the necessary tools to fuel the imagination, strengthen the visual sense and improve your professional qualifications.</p>
